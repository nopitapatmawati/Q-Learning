Reinforcement learning with Q-Learning
Build a Q-learning system to find the optimum policy so that the Agent in the Start position (1,1) is able to find the Goal in position (10.10) by getting the maximum Total Reward on the world grid. In this case, the Agent can only take four actions: N, E, S, and W which respectively state North (up), East (right), South (down), and West (to the left). You may use any scheme in implementing an episode.
